Ingress is a Kubernetes object that provides routing rules for your cluster. It manages the incomming traffic and routes it to the services running inside the cluster.
Seldon Core supports using either Istio or Ambassador to manage incomming traffic. Seldon Core automatically creates the objects and rules required to route traffic to your deployed machine learning models.
